Observe everything that happens in the heavens. See how the stars and heavenly bodies stay in their paths and follow their appointed order, rising and setting each season as planned.

Look at the earth and notice the things that happen on it from beginning to end. See how steady and unchanging they are, showing you the works of God. Notice the summer and winter seasons, when the earth is filled with water, and clouds, dew, and rain cover it.

See how in winter, most trees look like they have withered and lost their leaves, except for fourteen trees that keep their leaves for two or three years until new ones come.

In summer, notice how the sun is high above the earth, making you seek shade from its heat. The earth also heats up so much that it can be too hot to walk on.

Observe how trees cover themselves with green leaves and bear fruit. Pay attention to all of God’s works and see how the eternal God made them.

Every year, His works continue without change, as they fulfill the purpose He created them for, just as He ordained.

The sea and rivers also continue their tasks without changing, following His commands.

But you have not remained steadfast, nor followed God’s commandments. Instead, you have turned away and spoken proud and harsh words with impure mouths against His greatness. You, with hard hearts, will find no peace.

Because of this, you will curse your days, and your lives will be filled with sorrow. Your years will be marked by destruction and eternal disgrace, without mercy.

In those days, your names will be cursed by all the righteous, and all sinners and godless people will use you as an example of those to be cursed.

But the righteous will rejoice, finding forgiveness, mercy, peace, and patience. There will be salvation for them, a bright light.

For sinners, there will be no salvation; only the curse of the beast will remain on them.

For the chosen ones, there will be light, joy, and peace, and they will inherit the earth.

Then, the chosen will be given wisdom and will live without sin, avoiding both ungodliness and pride. The wise among them will remain humble.

They will no longer disobey or sin in their lifetimes, nor will they die in anger or rage. They will complete their lives in peace.

Their days will be filled with peace, and their years will multiply in eternal joy and gladness.
