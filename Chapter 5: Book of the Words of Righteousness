Enoch receives a vision from God and a command to deliver a message to the Watchers—angels who defied heaven by coming to earth, marrying human women, and creating giants, causing chaos and sin.

Enoch writes a petition on behalf of the Watchers, who want forgiveness. But God declares that their request is denied forever. They are to be bound to earth and will witness the destruction of their offspring, finding no peace or forgiveness.

In his vision, Enoch is lifted up to heaven, where he sees a grand, crystal-like wall surrounded by fire. Inside, he finds a magnificent, fiery house filled with angels and celestial lights. Beyond this, he sees God’s throne surrounded by flames, so bright and powerful that no one can approach. Thousands stand before God, yet He needs no guidance.

God calls Enoch forward and tells him to speak to the Watchers, saying: “You were meant to guide humanity, not to fall into earthly desires and sin with them. You left heaven, married human women, and had giant offspring. As spiritual beings, you were immortal and didn’t need wives, but you sought earthly pleasures and brought harm to the world.”

God declares that the spirits of the giants, born from these unions, will remain on earth as evil spirits. These spirits will cause trouble, destruction, and suffering, rising against humans until the final day of judgment.

To the Watchers, Enoch is to say: “You were once in heaven, but you revealed secrets to humanity that caused great evil. Because of this, you will have no peace.”
