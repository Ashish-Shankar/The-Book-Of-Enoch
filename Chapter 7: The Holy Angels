1. These are the names of the holy angels who watch over humanity:
   - Uriel, who rules over the world and Tartarus.
   - Raphael, who is responsible for human spirits.
   - Raguel, who takes vengeance on the luminaries.
   - Michael, who oversees the best of humanity and controls chaos.
   - Saraqael, who watches over spirits that have sinned.
   - Gabriel, who guards Paradise, serpents, and Cherubim.
   - Remiel, set over those who will rise.

2. I went to a chaotic, terrifying place with no heaven above or solid ground below. I saw seven stars bound like fiery mountains. I asked Uriel, who explained, “These stars transgressed God’s command, so they are bound here for ten thousand years as punishment.”

3. Then I saw another even more dreadful place: a huge fire with endless columns of flame reaching down to the abyss. Uriel told me this is the prison for angels who have sinned and are to be bound forever.

4. I visited another location with four deep, smooth, hollow places. Raphael explained these were created to gather the spirits of the dead until the day of judgment. There are separate areas for the righteous, the unjudged sinners, and the most wicked.

5. I blessed the Lord for His righteousness and mercy.

6. From there, I saw a constant, burning fire in the west, and Raguel explained it chases the heavenly bodies as part of their cycle.

7. Moving on, I encountered seven stunning mountains, the highest of which was like a throne, surrounded by fragrant trees and a beautiful, unique tree with an incomparable aroma and eternal life. Michael explained, “This tree is reserved for the righteous after judgment, symbolizing life and blessing.”

8. I blessed the Eternal King for His kindness in preparing such things for the righteous.

9. I continued to another area where aromatic trees like frankincense and myrrh grew. Beyond this, I found a valley filled with streams and fragrant cinnamon. Further on, I saw nectar-producing trees and aloe trees with a rich, sweet aroma when burned.

10. At the end of the earth, I saw magnificent trees, including the Tree of Knowledge, with fruit that gives wisdom. Raphael told me, “This is the tree that gave wisdom to Adam and Eve.”

11. At the ends of the earth, I saw unique creatures and birds, each with its own appearance, beauty, and voice. Nearby, Uriel showed me how the stars and planets exit through portals, each with its own course and timing, marked by laws and names.

12. Traveling north, I saw three portals through which cold, hail, frost, and rain enter the world. One portal brings good winds, but the other two bring hardship.

13. In the west, I saw three similar portals, and the same in the south and east, where stars follow their paths.

14. I praised the Lord of Glory, who created these wonders for angels, spirits, and people to see and to honor His work.
