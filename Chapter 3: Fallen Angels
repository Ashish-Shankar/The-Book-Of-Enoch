When people multiplied on earth, they had many beautiful daughters.

The angels, who were heavenly beings, saw these women and desired them. They said to each other, "Let’s choose wives from among humans and have children with them."

Their leader, Semjaza, said, "I’m afraid you won’t go through with this plan, and I’ll be the only one who ends up paying for this great sin."

They all replied, "Let’s swear an oath together, promising not to abandon this plan but to go through with it."

So they all swore together, binding themselves with a vow. There were two hundred of them, and they descended to Mount Hermon in the days of Jared. They named it Mount Hermon because they swore and bound themselves there.

Here are the names of their leaders: Samlazaz (the main leader), Araklba, Rameel, Kokablel, Tamlel, Ramlel, Danel, Ezeqeel, Baraqijal, Asael, Armaros, Batarel, Ananel, Zaqlel, Samsapeel, Satarel, Turel, Jomjael, Sariel. These were their chiefs.

Together, they took wives from among humans, each choosing one. They lived with them and corrupted themselves with them.

They taught the women spells, enchantments, how to cut roots, and introduced them to various plants.

The women became pregnant and gave birth to giants, who were extremely tall (three thousand ells). These giants consumed all the food people had. When humans couldn’t sustain them anymore, the giants turned against people and began to eat them.

They started to sin against birds, animals, reptiles, and fish, devouring each other’s flesh and drinking blood. The earth then cried out against these lawless ones.

Azazel taught people to make swords, knives, shields, and armor. He showed them how to work with metals, make jewelry and ornaments, use antimony (a cosmetic), beautify the eyelids, and use precious stones and dyes.

With this, much godlessness arose. People were led astray and became corrupt in every way.

Semjaza taught spells and root-cutting; Armaros taught how to break spells; Baraqijal taught astrology; Kokabel taught about the constellations; Ezeqeel taught about clouds; Araqiel taught the signs of the earth; Shamsiel taught the signs of the sun; and Sariel taught the course of the moon.

As people suffered and perished, they cried out, and their cries reached up to heaven.
