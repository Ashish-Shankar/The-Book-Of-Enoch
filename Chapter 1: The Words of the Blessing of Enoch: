This is the blessing of Enoch, who blessed the chosen and righteous people who will live in a time of hardship, when all wicked and godless people will be removed.

Enoch, a righteous man who was given understanding by God, shared his vision: "I saw the vision of the Holy One in heaven, shown to me by angels. They told me everything, and I understood it, though it was not meant for my generation but for a future one."

Speaking about the chosen, Enoch said: "The Holy Great One will come from His dwelling place. The eternal God will come down to earth, even to Mount Sinai, and appear with His great strength from the highest heavens.

Everyone will be filled with fear; even the Watchers (angels who watch over the world) will tremble. Great fear will spread to the ends of the earth.

The high mountains will shake, and the hills will be flattened. They will melt like wax before a flame. The earth will split open, and everything on it will be destroyed, and there will be a judgment upon all.

But God will make peace with the righteous. He will protect the chosen ones, show them mercy, and they will belong to Him. They will prosper and be blessed. He will help them, and they will receive light. God will make peace with them.

Look! He comes with ten thousand holy ones to carry out judgment on all, to destroy the ungodly, and to bring justice for all the ungodly things they have done and the harsh words they have spoken against Him."
