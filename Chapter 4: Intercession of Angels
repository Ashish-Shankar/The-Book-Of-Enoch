Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw the bloodshed and lawlessness on earth.

They said to each other, "The earth, which was created without sin, now cries out to heaven because of the violence."

The souls of the people who have died cry out to the holy ones in heaven, saying, "Bring our case before the Most High."

They prayed to the Lord, saying, "Lord of lords, King of kings, and God of all ages, Your glorious throne is eternal, and Your holy name is blessed forever. You created everything and have power over all. Nothing is hidden from You; You see everything.

You see what Azazel has done. He taught people forbidden knowledge from heaven, and Samlazaz, who has power over others, led them.

They went to human women, had relations with them, and revealed many sins. Their children became giants, and the earth was filled with violence and corruption.

The souls of those who died are crying out, and their cries won’t stop because of the wicked deeds done on earth.

You know everything before it happens. You see this, and You allow it, yet You have not told us what to do about it."

Then the Most High, the Holy and Great One, spoke. He sent Uriel to Noah, son of Lamech, saying, "Go to Noah and tell him, ‘Hide yourself!’ Warn him that a flood is coming to destroy everything on earth. Instruct him to save himself and his family for future generations."

The Lord told Raphael, "Bind Azazel hand and foot, and throw him into the darkness in the desert of Dudael. Cover him with rough rocks and darkness so he cannot see light. He will remain there until the day of judgment when he will be thrown into the fire.

Heal the earth, which the angels have corrupted. Announce the earth's healing so that people won’t die from the secret knowledge that the Watchers have taught. Azazel is responsible for all sin."

The Lord told Gabriel, "Take action against the lawless and wicked offspring of the Watchers. Make them fight each other so that they destroy themselves. They will not live long, and no prayers for them will be answered, for they hope to live forever."

The Lord said to Michael, "Bind Samlazaz and his associates, who have defiled themselves with human women. When their sons have destroyed each other, bind them for seventy generations in the earth's valleys until the final judgment, when they will be cast into eternal fire.

Those who are condemned will be bound with them forever. Destroy all evil spirits and the children of the Watchers because they have wronged humanity.

Remove all sin from the earth. Let righteousness and truth flourish and be a blessing. Righteous works will grow in truth and joy forever.

The righteous will be saved and live long lives, having many children, and they will live in peace.

The whole earth will be tilled with righteousness and full of blessings.

Beautiful trees will grow, vineyards will yield abundant wine, and each measure of seed will yield a thousandfold. Olives will produce a rich harvest of oil.

Cleanse the earth of oppression, sin, and all impurity. Remove all evil from it.

All people will become righteous, all nations will praise Me, and all will worship Me. The earth will be cleansed, and I will never again bring punishment upon it from generation to generation.

In those days, I will open the heavens to pour down blessings upon the earth for humanity’s work. Truth and peace will be together throughout the world for all time."

Before these things happened, Enoch was hidden, and no one knew where he was. He spent his days with the holy ones and dealt with the Watchers.

Enoch praised the Lord of Majesty, and the Watchers called him, saying, "Enoch, the scribe of righteousness, go and tell the Watchers of heaven who have left their holy place and defiled themselves with women.

Tell them: ‘You have caused great destruction on earth, and you will have no peace or forgiveness.’"

Because they love their children, they will see their destruction and lament over them forever, but they will find no mercy or peace."

Enoch went and told Azazel, "You will have no peace. A severe judgment has been pronounced against you. You will be bound because of the sins you taught and the wickedness you revealed to humanity."

Then Enoch spoke to all the Watchers together, and they were terrified. They begged him to write a petition for their forgiveness and read it before the Lord.

They could no longer speak with God or look up to heaven because of the shame of their sins and the judgment upon them.

Enoch wrote their petition and prayer for their forgiveness and for mercy.

Then he went to the waters of Dan and read their petition until he fell asleep.

In a dream, he saw visions of punishment, and a voice told him to report it to the sons of heaven and rebuke them.

When he awoke, he went to the Watchers, who were weeping together in a place called Abelsjail, covering their faces in shame.

Enoch told them all the visions he had seen in his dream, and he spoke words of righteousness to rebuke the Watchers.
