In this vision, Enoch is taken by angels to various extraordinary places that reveal the mysteries of creation and judgment.

First, the angels lead Enoch to a place filled with fiery beings who can transform into human form at will. From there, they take him to a dark mountain whose peak reaches heaven. Enoch sees the realms of light—stars, thunder, and lightning—guarded by weapons of fire. He is also brought to rivers of fire flowing like water into the western sea, symbolizing the cycle of day and night.

Enoch witnesses the great rivers, places of eternal darkness, and the sources of the deep waters. He sees the storehouses of winds that shape creation, the earth’s foundation stones, and the pillars that uphold the heavens. The winds move the sun, stars, and clouds along their paths, and angels travel on designated routes, keeping creation in motion.

Reaching the edge of the earth, Enoch sees a land where flames burn day and night, surrounded by seven magnificent mountains. Three of these mountains are to the east, with precious stones like pearls and jacinth; three to the south are of red stone. The middle mountain, rising like God’s throne, is made of alabaster and crowned with sapphire, symbolizing divine presence.

Beyond these mountains, Enoch sees an abyss of endless fire with pillars stretching both deep and high. Past this abyss lies a desolate, barren wasteland without heaven above or earth below—silent and empty, void of life.

In this bleak region, Enoch sees seven stars burning like mountains. An angel explains that this place is a prison for celestial beings who disobeyed God, failing to appear at their appointed times in the heavens. Angered by their rebellion, God bound them in this prison to await judgment.

Uriel, an archangel, tells Enoch that here, too, the angels who sinned by uniting with human women will be held. These fallen angels, now taking various forms, lead humanity astray, causing them to worship demons as gods. Their punishment will be finalized on the day of great judgment, where both they and the women they influenced will face eternal consequences.

Enoch alone sees these visions of the end of all things, something no other human will witness as he has.
